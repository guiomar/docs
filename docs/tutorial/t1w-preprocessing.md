## Anatomical (T1w) preprocessing.

This page demonstrate common steps used to preprocess anatomical magnetic resonance imaging data (T1-weighted or T1w) on brainlife.io The goal of this turorial is to show how process anatomical data for successive analyses â€“ volumetric analyses from T1w meausres, combination of T1w and diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) or functional neuroimaging data (fMRI) pipelines.

This tutorial will use a combination of skills developed in the introduction-to-brainlife tutorial (https://brainlife.io/docs/tutorial/introduction-to-brainlife/). If you have not read this, or you are not comfortable staging, processing, archiving and viewing data on brainlife.io, please go back and follow that tutorial before beginning this one.

### 1. Set the orientation of the brain.

The first step is to make sure the anatomy of the brain 'looks right.' This means that the coordinate system for the T1w image is stored rotated such that the brain appears up-right and centered when opened in the major visualization toolboxes that the scientific community uses (i.e., generally we look at images where the nose faces towards right-hand side in the sagittal plane, and forward in the axial and coronal planes). This rotation involves changing information in the T1w data files and headers. Beside agreeing to the standard convetions, this orientation is important because it assures that the data inside the T1w iamges will be "indexed,"  or read, appropirately allowing different software libraries for neuroimaging data analysis to  read the data, interpret the position and dimensions of individual three-dimensional pixels (i.e., voxels). During this process oftentimes the neck is removed from the original MRI data, so to fit the image within an adequate volume. This can be done on brainlife.io using the [Crop & Reorient T1](https://brainlife.io/app/5a0f38bf31769f1e4d46cc58) app.

### 2. Anterior Commissure - Posterior Commissure (ACPC) alignment.

The next step is to align the anatomical image to the point where two white matter tracts cross hemispheres: the anterior commissure and posterior commissure (ACPC). The anterior commissure connects the two temporal lobes and is located below the anterior portion of the corpus callosum (i.e. fornix), the large white matter tract connecting the two hemispheres. The posterior commissure is located just behind the cerebral aqueduct, an important connection between the third and fourth ventricles. This step will move the image in a way that effectively "centers" the image. Specifically, the image will be moved so that a horizontal line drawn from the front to the back of the brain will pass through both landmarks, and a horizontal line drawn from the temporal lobes and a vertical line from the top of the brain to the bottom bisect at the midpoint of the two landmarks. A majority of the following processing steps require the anatomical image to be aligned to the ACPC plane, including Freesurfer parcellation. This can be done on brainlife.io using the [HCP ACPC Alignment (T1w)](https://brainlife.io/app/5c61c69f14027a01b14adcb3) app.

### 3. Freesurfer Brain Parcellation - Generation.

The next step is perform anatomical preprocessing and divide (i.e. parcellate) the brain into different regions and tissue types (i.e. white matter, gray matter) using Freesurfer. These regions represent different gray matter (i.e. cortical) landmarks such as the motor and somatosensory cortices, and are typically derived from histological properties of these regions. Sometimes, they are derived from functional activation (i.e. fMRI) patterns. Freesurfer will divide the anatomical image into different tissue types (i.e. white matter, gray matter), parcellate the gray matter into known anatomical landmarks, and output statistics regarding the volume and thickness of the different tissue types and anatomical landmarks. These regions are then used for a large number of downstream steps, including white matter tract segmentation. Information regarding the volume and thickness of each region can also be used for group analyses. This can be done on brainlife.io using the [Freesurfer](https://brainlife.io/app/58c56d92e13a50849b258801) app.

### 4. Freesurfer Brain Parcellation - Statistics.

The final step is to take the parcellation generated from Freesurfer and collate the important statistics into a .csv file for easy viewing and implementation of group analyses. Within each region of the parcellation (i.e. ROI), Freesurfer computes simple statistics regarding the number of vertices, surface area, volume, cortical thickness, mean and gaussian curvatures, and the fold and curvature indices. These statistics can be used to perform group-level analyses, including group differences within ROIs and correlation analyses with behavioral data. This can be done on brainlife.io using the [Freesurfer Statistics](https://brainlife.io/app/5e31bea8b81ce26c2f9c9a88) app.

1. ACPC align the anatomical (T1w) image, 
1. generate cortical and white matter surfaces and parcellations using Freesurfer,
1. obtain common statistics from the Freesurfer parcellation.
